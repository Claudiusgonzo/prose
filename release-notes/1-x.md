# Release Notes for PROSE SDK versions 1.x and before

## [Release 1.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/1.1.0) -- 2017/02/15

With this release we are starting a regular monthly public release rhythm.  The biggest change in this month's release
is major improvements to our samples and documentation.  At the same time we have added several small new features and
bug fixes.

### New Features

- Made more spec methods `protected internal` to enable third-party implementation of `Spec` subclasses.
- Added new documentation and samples to facilitate third-party DSL development. Fixes
  [\#10](https://github.com/Microsoft/prose/issues/10).
- More flexibility in time ranges in `Transformation.Text`.
- Allowed omitting leading zeros at the start of numeric date formats in `Transformation.Text`.

### Bug Fixes

- Improved `RunMerge`'s handling of empty lines in `Split.File`.
- Fixed learning with missing lookahead/lookbehind regexes in `Extraction.Text`
  ([\#7](https://github.com/Microsoft/prose/issues/7)).
- Improved `Extraction.Json`'s handling of documents where the top-level is an array or a single object containing an
  array.
- Several bug fixes that improve stability, performance and reduce the number of examples required to learn the intended
  program across the SDK.
