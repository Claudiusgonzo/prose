    - Readability enhancements to Python translation.
- Matching.Text
    - Generate better regex to match newlines.

## [Release 6.8.1](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.8.1) -- 2018/10/18

### Breaking Changes

- Compound.Split
    - `ReadInputFromReaders(TextReader reader)` and `ReadInputLineCount(int limit)` are deprecated. They are replaced by
      `ReadInput(TextReader reader, int linesToRead=200)`. This release also introduces `ReadInput(string s, int
      linesToRead=200)`.

-   Extraction.Json
    -   Removed the optional `JPath` parameter from the constraint `JoinSingleTopArray` – the new constraint `JoinArray`

### New Features

-   Common Framework
	-   New learning/running exception hierarchy to raise friendlier exceptions.

-   Detection.DataType
	-   Support added to specify the list of types to detect.

-   Extraction.Json

        unsupported targets.

-   Transformation.Text
	-   Introduce readable translation for number formatting and lookup programs.

-   Transformation.Tree:
    -   `Node.Value` of type `string` has been replaced by `Node.Attributes` of type `Dictionary<string, string>` to
        permit learning from distinct attributes.

## [Release 6.7.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.7.0) -- 2018/09/20

### New Features

- Common framework
    - Configurable equality for `FeatureCalculationContext`; Classes implementing `IFeature` can now force deep/shallow
      equality computation over inputs leading to potential performance improvements during learning by setting
      `IFeature.UseComputedInputsForFccEquality` (`false` is the old behavior).

- Compound.Split
    - Support free-form fixed-width schema.
    - Add `SkipLinesCount` constraint to manually specify number of header lines to skip instead of learning it.

- Matching.Text
    - Support added for learning with `InSameCluster` and `InDifferentCluster` constraints which take a set of inputs to
      be required to appear in the same or different clusters respectively.
    - Support added for `UseLongConstantOptimization` constraint which aggressively generates constant tokens whenever
      possible. (Note: This makes the learning incompelete.)

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Common framework
    - Optimizations and style improvements in quality of generated Python code.

- Compound.Split
    - Bug fixes in fixed-width file ingestion.
    - Correctly handle fixed-width files where all lines start with whitespace.
    - Fixes to Python translation.

- Extraction.Text
    - Improved learning performance in the presence of negative constraints. This fixes the performance regression
      introduced in 6.6.0.

- Extraction.Json
    - Fix handling of JSON with a single array of values in pandas Python translation.

- Extraction.Web
    - Improvements in predictive table detection to remove certain kinds of redundant columns.
    - Improved row selector inference based on ancestor nodes rather than just the boundary nodes.


## [Release 6.6.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.6.0) -- 2018/08/20

### Breaking Changes

- Compound.Split
    - The property `FieldStartPositions` has been removed and a new `IReadOnlyList<Record<int, int?>> FieldPositions`
      property has been added in its place.

### New Features

- Common Framework
    - Support for serialization and deserialization of spec objects (used to track subtasks during synthesis).

- Compound.Split
    - Support for fixed width files with gaps between fields.
    - Improvement in column name learning for some cases (e.g. single column and single row data sets).
    - Support for generating PySpark code from learned program.

- Detection
    - Support for rich datatype detection on CoreClr (in addition to .net framework where it was previously supported).
    - Includes example values for each detected numeric and date type in the data.

- Extraction.Json
    - Supports a new constraint which may be used to disable handling of invalid JSON.  This constraint should be
      specified if clients translate learned programs to Java and use that java with a Jackson library version less than
      v2.8 since otherwise the generated Java code contains Jackson v2.8+ features.  (NOTE: This version of Jackson is
      particularly significant since Spark currently only allows Jackson v2.8.)
    - Support for generating PySpark code from learned program.

- Extraction.Web
    - Updated AngleSharp dependency to its latest release to address security concerns in that library.
    - Support for explicit HTML tables when run in predictive mode.

- Matching.Text
    - Includes examples of each pattern in comments next to the pattern in the generated Python code.

- Transformation.Text
    - Support for serialization and deserialization for all types referenced in the grammar.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Common Framework
    - Bug fixes in ProgramSet.TopK(k) method to return no less than k programs. Temporarily, this slightly degrades
      Extraction.Text learn performance, which will be fixed soon.

- Extraction.Json
    - More consistent handling of invalid/truncated Json files.

- Matching.Text
    - Improvements in PySpark translation

- Transformation.Text
    - Improvements in readability of generated Python code

- Transformation.Tree:
    - Performance improvement in clustering of transformations by up to 10x depending on scenario.
    - Performance improvement using incremental learning such that previously learned programs are updated with newer
      examples provided on subsequent Learn() calls.

## [Release 6.5.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.5.0) -- 2018/07/23

### New Features

- Extraction.Web:
    - Now supports predictive table extraction from webpages (that is, from 0 examples).

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Common framework:
    - Added support for a common extension hook for custom entity detectors.  This hook is currently used in 
      Extraction.Web and Transformation.Text but could theoretically be supported in any DSL. 
- Compound.Split:
    - Now supports fixed-width schema files which are themselves delimited.
- Detection:
    - Fixed a bug where running detection on a set of empty strings produced a NullReferenceException.
    - Fixed a bug where numbers of the form \d+\.\d+ were not recognized correctly.
- Extraction.Json:
    - Added a parameter to enable/disable support for trailing commas in java translation.  The library we use for json
      parsing in java (Jackson) has support for trailing commas in newer versions, but some environments only allow the
      older version of Jackson which does not have this support.
    - Now has a new constraint to automatically flatten a json document.  When this constraint is used, it’s possible to
      translate the learned program to python which builds on the pandas library.
- Extraction.Web:
    - Improved nth-child selection ranking in predictive extraction.  Nth-child selection is important for detecting
      table columns in some cases, but in others it can introduce a lot of noise.  The system now uses nth-child
      selection only as a fall-back if prominent tables cannot be detected otherwise.
    - Text normalization (which currently ensures that text to node matching is whitespace insensitive) has been
      extended to insensitivity of other special characters such as variations in quotes, dashes, ellipses, etc.
- Transformation.Text:
    - Readability of python translations is improved in some cases by removing unnecessary wrapping functions/classes.
    - Python translator now creates much more readable translations for programs including date time rounding.

## [Release 6.4.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.4.0) -- 2018/06/26

### Breaking Changes

- Common Framework
    - When running on CoreClr, we now require runtime version 2.0.3 or newer.  Previously we had workarounds for a
      CoreClr bug that was fixed in 2.0.3, but those are now removed. 
- Compound.Split
    - Learning fixed width programs from a schema file is now specified by a constraint which contains a schema file
      parameter.
- Extraction.Json
    - New default behavior not to automatically join inner arrays.  The old behavior may be requested by supplying the
      new constraint ‘JoinInnerArrays’.  (Previous constraint ‘NoJoinInnerArrays’ has been removed.)
    - Inputs can now be used as an implicit flatten constraint, and the old explicit FlattenDocument constraint is
      removed.
    - Flattening top-level arrays is only applied when there is only one.  If multiple top-level arrays are present,
      they are all preserved.
    - Constraints are renamed to make their meaning clearer:
        - JoinInnerArrays -> JoinAllArrays
        - NormalizeArrays -> JoinSingleTopArray
        - SplitTopArrayToColumns -> SplitTopArrays

### New Features

- Common Framework
    - VSA data structures now support Serialization and Deserialization
- Compound.Split
    - Now handles small fixed-width files.
    - Now supports selecting a subset of columns for the output.
- Detection:
    - Data type detection now supports detecting bit types.
    - Data type detection now takes a CultureInfo parameter and supports identifying a type from multiple string
      values—not just one.
    - Improved data type detection algorithms have been implemented for numbers, dates, Booleans and categorical values.
- Extraction.Json
    - Now supports trailing commas.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Compound.Split
    - Improved learning of header/skip.
    - It is now possible to construct a program from a ProgramProperties structure (which can be extracted from a
      learned program).
    - It is also now possible to override some learned properties.  This supports the scenario where a program is
      learned from an input file, metadata is presented to the user, and then the user can override some of that
      metadata before using a final program based on the modified properties.
- Extraction.Json
    - New NormalizeArray constraint which directs the system to flatten only one array—either with a specified path or
      the first, top array if no path is specified.
- Extraction.Web
    - Now supports specialized selectors for HTML tables to ensure they are always handled when possible.
    - Dashes are no longer escaped in CSS selectors making them more readable.
    - Now supports boundary-based semantics for row-selectors in web table programs.
    - Increased maximum allowed offset for satisfying examples to 5.
    - Row selectors may now satisfy examples up to the maximum permitted offset if an exact match cannot be found.
    - Previous program constraint is now used to ensure partial success—that is we always satisfy any previously
      satisfied columns for which the examples have not changed (in preference to success on any new columns).
    - When new examples are given in a session where a learn was previously performed, if the new program no longer
      satisfies previously satisfied columns, we now consider those columns satisfied if the previous column examples
      shift by less than some number of rows specified as a threshold in the public API.  If they aren’t satisfied at
      all or the shifting is greater than that number of rows, then the system falls back to the previously learned
      program to ensure that the previously satisfied columns are still satisfied.
    - An issue was fixed so that we now ensure correct alignment when the row selector has been previously computed.
- Matching.Text
    - Fixed a bug in the python translation which didn’t properly quote regexes.
- Split.Text
    - Improved detection of time expressions.
- Transformation.Text
    - Python translation no longer exposes the Substring type unless optimizing for performance in order to simplify the
      generated code.
    - Python translation now special cases a common idiom in the translation.text DSL related to regex matching and
      turns it into simpler code.
    - Improved readability of python translation for some datetime programs.
    - Generated programs that use regular expressions now contain simpler/easier to read expressions in a number of
      cases.
- Transformation.Tree
    - Performance improved.
    - Fixed an issue in the Order By conversion.
    - Fixed issues with the generation of join expressions.
    - Table name analysis is now more robust with respect to qualified names, cases and quoted names.
    - Program now exposes separate methods for finding the nodes that should be changed and for performing the
      transformation instead of just doing the whole operation in a single method call.

## [Release 6.3.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.3.0) -- 2018/05/15

### Breaking Changes

- Matching.Text
    - ForbidConstantTokens constraint has been removed.
- Transformation.Tree
    - Utils.Parse has been renamed to Utils.ParseStatementIgnoreWhiteSpace
    
### New Features

- Compound.Split
    - Key/Value extraction now supports fixed width extraction such as where the keys and values are in a table where
      the values all start at the same column position.
    - Now supports skipping empty, comment and footer records.
- Transformation.Text
    - Now supports pluggable Entity Detectors specified in a constraint.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Common Framework
    - PROSE now depends on a slightly older version of Newtonsoft.Json (v9.0.1) for .Net Framework consumers.  For
      .Net Core PROSE still requires Newtonsoft.Json v10.0.3.
    - Code produced by the Java translation now makes fewer allocations in some scenarios.
    - Our Python translation now produces more readable string literals.
- Compound.Split
    - The Python produced for cases which pandas cannot handle is improved with function names and parameters that
      align with pandas, documentation on public parts and simpler generated code.
- Extraction.Web
    - When learning a new program, soft constraints are now used for any columns where the user has not changed the
      examples instead of only if the user has added new columns but not changed examples for any previous columns.
    - Significant improvement in learn times.
    - Text comparisons are now insensitive to whitespace characters.
- Transformation.Text
    - Python translation is now more readable in many cases.
- Transformation.Tree
    - DSL rewritten to support additional scenarios.
    - The Program class now has a field to expose a list of learned transformation rule programs. Each transformation
      rule exposes an Edit program. In this way, users can pick which of the learned edits  they want to apply and
      apply them to specific nodes bypassing the filter checking.
    - Performance improvements.

## [Release 6.2.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.2.0) -- 2018/04/25

### Breaking Changes

- Matching.Text
    - The `Patterns` property has been removed.  Patterns should be retrieved by calling the `LearnPatterns()`
      method on the session object instead.

### New Features

- Changes that only affect those building their own DSLs
    - The [Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/prose) contain a new DSL Authoring tutorial.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Compound.Split
    - The system now attempts to learn an ingestion program that obeys standard CSV quoting first
      and then falls back to the more flexible strategy only if the standard doesn’t work.
- Extraction.Web
    - Fixed bugs with case insensitive comparisons and normalization.
- Matching.Text
    - Fixed a bug in the handling of cancellation tokens.  Now we check for cancellation much more frequently.
    - Fixed handling of null strings.
    - Improved readability and performance of python translations.
- Transformation.Text
    - Significant inputs has improved performance and accuracy.
- Common Framework
    - The interface for implementing a subprogram translator has been enhanced.

## [Release 6.1.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.1.0) -- 2018/04/16

### New Features

- Compound.Split
    - Can now extract the schema of a fixed width file from a free-form text file description of the schema and use that
      to learn an extraction program.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- Compound.Split
    - Fixed width inference (for cases where the schema file is not available) is improved to prevent splitting inside
      standard data types.
    - Python translation now produces code that calls Pandas for supported CSV and fixed-width files.

- Extraction.Web
    - The NormalizeHtml method is now significantly simpler and more robust.
    - Now supports table constraints in which some cell examples are soft constraints (that is, they need not
      necessarily be satisfied but they help to converge to correct programs).  This can be useful in interactive
      settings where if the user provides new examples after a previous learning round, then any output of the previous
      learning round which the user has not changed can be treated as soft constraints.

- Transformation.Text
    - Learning performance improvements.
    - Improved readability of learned programs through constant folding.
    - Fixes to conditional program learning such that the correct program is learned and returned in more cases instead
      of the system indicating that it could not learn a program.  Also conditional patterns are better clustered
      together.

- Changes that only affect those building their own DSLs
    - The PROSE grammar specification language has been changed to only allow binding single variables in let
      expressions. None of our existing grammars used a let with multiple variables, and we decided to simplify the
      grammar handling logic by enforcing this as a constraint.
    - AST “holes” now have Ids and are equal if they have the same symbol and id.
    - There is a new subprogram translator extension point interface which enables pattern based code generators to be
      plugged into the overall translation system.

## [Release 6.0.0](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis/6.0.0) -- 2018/03/19

### Breaking Changes

- Our session base class no longer implements `IDisposable`, and its serialization format has changed because the 
  `AllowBackgroundComputations` member has been deleted.
  
- Session constraints and inputs are now maintained in smart collections rather than having custom Add/Remove methods.
    - For most consuming code the fix is just to replace calls to `session.AddConstraints` with
      `session.Constraints.Add` and `session.AddInputs` with `session.Inputs.Add` 
- The Python and Java translators now all take an OptimizeFor parameter which does NOT have a default value.  Callers
  should specify a value of OptimizeFor.Performance or OptimizeFor.Readability (where readability means that the program
  synthesized should be as easy as possible for humans to read and understand even if that means some reduction in the
  speed of execution for that program).
  
- Matching.Text no longer allows specifying negative examples or positive examples that are marked as hard constraints.
  Since the current implementation treats all examples as soft constraints, the API now makes that explicit.  Similarly,
  the `DisjunctionLimit` constraint is also always a soft constraint.
  
- Transformation.Text's `GetSignificantInputClustersAsync` method has been removed and replaced with
  `GetSignificantInputsAsync`.

### New Features

- Compound.Split
    - Now supports Multi-record splitting which enables splitting of files with key-value pairs and pivoting the results
      into a table with the keys as columns.

### Bug Fixes / Enhancements

- The `LearnTopK` method on `Session` has a new optional parameter for requesting not only the top K programs but also a
  random sample of additional programs learned.
  
- The dependency on the native Z3 library has been removed.

- Improvements to translation of programs.
    - Avoid lifting constants if translator is not opted for Performance.
    - Modify Python translator to not create classes for simple programs.
    - Perform Constant propagation, Copy propagation and Common subexpression optimization on translated programs
      (Java and Python).
    - Other readability improvements like aliasing in Python and shortening Python operator names.
    - Compound.Split now supports Python translations for simple delimiter and fixed width cases.  In an upcoming
      release all Compound.Split programs will support Python translation.
    - Specific to Transformation.Text
        - By default the generated program has a more natural function signature with an argument for each input column
          that is named appropriately rather than a taking a single dictionary of the inputs.
        - Programs produced use the more idiomatic + for concat and [:] for slice in appropriate places.
        - Dead-code elimination.
        - Function calls are not inlined but variables and literals are.
        - An extra variable is no longer created for the return value of a function.
- Extraction.Web
    - No longer escapes certain occurrences of hyphen in CSS selectors (when it occurs between two letters, a very
      common case) making them more readable.
    - Now supports entity-based extraction programs that include operators to extract data with respect to surrounding
      entities in the DOM context (e.g. extracting dates from bill receipts across different formats and providers).
    - A new previous program constraint which enables incremental table learning where a previously synthesized program
      can be supplied when synthesizing a new program which adds additional row/column selection information.  This can
      bring significant perf benefits for synthesizing programs to extract large tables.
    - Case insensitive text matching.
    - Possibly null values  are prevented in single column extractions.
    - Improved predicate learning to most specific and smallest selectors.
- Split.Text (and by extension Compound.Split)
    - Improvements to fixed width file detection including:
        - Better number data type recognition to include numbers preceded by “+/-“.
        - Reduced false positive left aligned column detection.
- Transformation.Text
    - Fixed a bug in datetime rounding learning where sometimes too many dates were rounded.
